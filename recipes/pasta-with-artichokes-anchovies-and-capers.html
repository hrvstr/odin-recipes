      >Original recipe</a

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>320g farfalle</li>
      <li>8 small artichokes</li>
      <li>2 lemons, juice only</li>
      <li>6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
      <li>8–12 anchovy fillets</li>
      <li>2 banana shallots, finely chopped</li>
      <li>75g capers</li>
      <li>6 tbsp white wine</li>
      <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>handful finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>grated parmesan (or pecorino), to serve</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil and cook the pasta
        until al dente – check the packet instructions for the cooking time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, clean the artichokes by removing all the leaves until you get
        to the heart. Slice in half, and remove the hairy choke. Prepare a bowl
        of water and pour the lemon juice in. Slice the hearts finely and place
        in the bowl of water until you are ready to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the anchovies and fry over a
        medium-high heat for about 2–3 minutes, or until crisp. Add the shallots
        and fry for another minute. Drain the artichokes and add them to the
        pan, then stir-fry for about 2 minutes until softened, but not mushy.
        Add the capers, then add the white wine and simmer to allow some of it
        to evaporate. Season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the pasta, reserving a little of the cooking water. Add the pasta
        to the sauce in the pan with a little of the reserved cooking water and
        mix well to combine. Stir in the chopped parsley.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the heat, drizzle with a little extra virgin oil, and serve
        with grated parmesan.
      </li>
