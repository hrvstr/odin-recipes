    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      It’s a shame that so many bad versions of this popular Emilian dish are
      found in fast food restaurants and ready-made in supermarkets. When made
      properly, lasagne is a delicious comfort food and is always a popular
      choice in my house for Sunday lunch or when we have a crowd. It can be
      made in advance and baked when required. It is made with the famous ragu
      Bolognese and egg pasta sheets typical of this region. I tend to use the
      dried lasagne sheets so readily available in shops but you can use fresh
      or even make your own!

        >
      </li>
      <li>40g butter</li>
      <li>40g plain flour</li>
      <li>500ml milk</li>
      <li>Salt & black pepper</li>
      <li>100g grated parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>About 8 dried egg lasagne sheets</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>First make the Bolognese ragu.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees centigrade.</li>
      <li>
        Make the white sauce – melt the butter in a small pan on a medium heat,
        remove from the heat, stir in the flour with a small hand whisk (this
        will avoid lumps from forming) until you get a paste, stir in a little
        milk. Return to the heat, add the remaining milk and stirring all the
        time, cook on a medium heat for about 3 to 4 minutes until the sauce
        begins to thicken. Remove from the heat, season with salt & pepper and
        stir in about a third of the grated parmesan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line an ovenproof dish with a little of the Bolognese sauce, arrange
        sheets of lasagne over followed by more sauce, then a layer of white
        sauce, sprinkle some grated parmesan and continue making layers like
        this until you have used up all the ingredients ending with a topping of
        white sauce and grated parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the hot oven for about 30 - 35 minutes until golden-brown.
        Remove, leave to rest for a couple of minutes and serve.
